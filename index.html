      <h1>Hey You</h1>
      <p>
        Yes you. Stop being unhappy with yourself. You are
        perfect. Stop wishing you looked like someone else or
        wishing people liked you as much as they like someone
        else. Stop trying to get attention from those who
        hurt you. Stop hating your body, your face, your
        personality, your quirks. Love them! Without those
        things you wouldn't be you. And why would you want
        to be anyone else? Be confident with who you are.
        Smile! It'll draw people in. If anyone hates you
        because you are happy with yourself then stuff them.
        Your happiness will not depend on others anymore.
        Say to them, "I am happy because I love who I am.
        I love my flaws. I love my imperfections. They make
        me me. And that "me" is awesome!
