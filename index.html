      <h1>Hey You</h1>
      <p>
        Yes, you. Stop being unhappy with yourself. You are perfect. Stop wishing you looked like someone else or
        wishing people liked you as much as they like someone else. Stop trying to get attention from those who hurt
        you. Stop hating your body, your face, your personality, and your quirks. Love them! Without those things, you
        would not be you. And why would you want to be anyone else? Be confident with who you are. Smile! It will draw
        people in. If anyone hates you because you are happy with yourself then stuff them. Your happiness will not
        depend on others anymore. Say to them, "I am happy because I love who I am. I love my flaws. I love my
        imperfections. They make me me. And that "me" is awesome!
